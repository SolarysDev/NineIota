# Zero Two

Welcome to the codebase for the (other) greatest waifu bot ever!

## Current Patch: Starboard (v1.2)
Starboard is now working and ready for the public! You can enable Starboard for your guild with `>>star` in the channel you want to set up for Starboard. You can disable it with `unstar` if you want to move it to a different channel or you just don't like the feature :'(.

## Roadmap
The following patches will be done in the order they are displayed, though exact timeframes are very much in the air, as I have to juggle development of the bot with school and a handful of other commitments.

### Guild Configuration
Welcome/Leave messages, setting `Muted` role for extended moderation capability, and (still up in the air) command-based role/channel manipulation, though I may move this to another project entirely.

### Music
A couple of things stand in the way of this. Firstly, I'm just a bad programmer and it'll take some time for me to learn Discord.Net's audio library, and music encoding/streaming also takes a fair toll on system resources. I'll definitely have to stop selfhosting and pick up a VPS capable of steaming audio. Music ***will*** drop eventually, though.

And here's a nice embed thingy cause DBL wants me to put it in.
